/* Chunk output can be customized with knitr options, arguments set in the {} of a chunk header. */

```
  include = FALSE [^1]
  echo    = FALSE [^2]
  message = FALSE [^3]
  warning = FALSE [^4]
  fig.cap = "..." [^5]
```

[^1]: Prevents code and results from appearing in the finished file. R Markdown still runs the code in the chunk, and the results can be used by other chunks.
[^2]: Prevents code, but not the results from appearing in the finished file. This is a useful way to embed figures.
[^3]: Prevents messages that are generated by code from appearing in the finished file.
[^4]: Prevents warnings that are generated by code from appearing in the finished.
[^5]: Adds a caption to graphical results.
